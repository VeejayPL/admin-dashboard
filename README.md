# Admin dashboard

## Description

This project was created for the Admin dashboard assignment as part of The Odin Project curriculum. The goal of this exercise was to practice creating the layout with grid property.

The responsive design was not part of the scope, thus the dashboard is best viewed on a full display desktop.
Minor responsiveness, ie. font clamp or media for small screens, has been added anyway.

You can take a look at [live demo](https://veejaypl.github.io/admin-dashboard/) or at the screenshot below.
